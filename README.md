A common concern expressed by users wanting to move to a de-googled Android ROM is: *Will my apps work without Google Play Services?*

This project aims to crowdsource data from countless custom ROM users so we can figure out what apps do/don't work without Google Play Services. Eventually I would like this to be an app you can download from F-Droid, and it'll conveniently let you rate all apps on your phone. But, currently this project will start here as a simple repo.  


## How To Contribute

This is just quickly thrown together so we can start collecting data. It's by no means perfect, and I know not everyone uses Github. Email me at support@techlore.tech with all your apps you use on your phone that are non-F-Droid applications as well as any compability issues you have with the applications. Make sure to mention the OS you're running, the version, if notifications work, any specific features, etc. I'll manually input these somehow in the near future. This will be much more official and easier to do soon. 

## Explanation
Google Play Services are an integral part of most Android devices that enable users to be able to utilize their Google account on their phone, as well as enable Google-specific features for applications who rely on them. 

When users move to a de-googled ROM like GrapheneOS or LineageOS, they are faced with opening their applications in hopes that they all work. Why hope when we can guarantee what will/won't work?
